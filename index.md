Father, husband, and scientist. 

## About

I am currently a graduate student in the Microbiology department at the University of California, Riverside; working in the Giraldo Lab, my projects focus on augmenting microbial abilities with nanoparticles. 

My dream is to create synthetic microbiology communication networks with nanotechnology that mimic the networks we see in nature: ants and their pheremone networks, plants and their micronutrient networks, microbes and their populations, and host/pathogen exploitation frameworks.

## Experience

###  at the University of California, Riverside in the Giraldo Lab (2017-current)
**_Graduate Student_, Microbiology Department**
- Graduate Student Association Representative for Microbiology
- Member, UC Student-Workers Union

### Cibus, San Diego CA (2012-2017)
**_Senior Research Associate_**
At Cibus I worked on automated liquid handling, research and development of microbial gene editing tools, and Illumina next-generation sequencing. 

### _B.S. Biology_ at the University of California, San Diego (2012)
**_Research Assistant_ at the Mayfield Laboratory**

As an undergrad in the Mayfield Laboratory, I worked on the production of anti-cancer proteins in the chloroplast of _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_.
