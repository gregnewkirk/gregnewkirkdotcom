## About

I am currently a graduate student in the Microbiology department at the University of California, Riverside; working in the Giraldo Lab, my projects focus on augmenting microbial abilities with nanoparticles. 

My dream is to create synthetic microbiology communication networks with nanotechnology that mimic the networks we see in nature: ants and their pheremone networks, plants and their micronutrient networks, microbes and their populations, and host/pathogen exploitation frameworks.
